# Tic-Tac-Toe-
This Tic Tac Toe game in Python is a two-player terminal game. Itâ€™s split into four parts: game.py handles game logic, board.py displays the board and checks win conditions, player.py manages player input, and run_game.py starts the game. Players alternate placing X or O on a 3x3 grid.
